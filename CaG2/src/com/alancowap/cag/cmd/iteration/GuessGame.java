/** 
 *  Demo iteration statements (e.g. do-while loop)
 *  Demo use of random number generation using java.util.Random
 *  A random number generator tries to guess a random number (1..20)
 *  
 *  Could you improve the program?
 *   1) how about getting the human to guess each number no more than once?
 *   2) how about keeping track of how many guesses were taken
 *   3) compare the number of guesses required before and after implementing (1) above
